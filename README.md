**Project Title: PORTFOLYX**

**Project Overview:**

Portfolyx is a web-based application designed to help students showcase their projects and portfolios while allowing teachers or institutions to monitor, manage, and provide feedback on student progress. This platform provides an interactive and user-friendly solution for tracking project milestones, uploading media files, and presenting student achievements in an organized manner.

The application features 3 roles: Admin (Institution), Teacher, and User (Student). The Admin can add teachers and students, manage their profiles, review all CRUD operations, and accept or reject entries. The Teacher can update their profile, view the projects and portfolios of assigned students, and provide feedback. The Student can update their profile, upload projects and portfolios, and manage updates for both. This system ensures streamlined workflows and effective collaboration between students, teachers, and administrators.

This project leverages Spring Boot for the backend, MySQL for database management, and JSP (Java Server Pages) for the frontend, with an optional integration of React for a modern, dynamic UI experience. The robust tech stack ensures scalability, security, and efficiency, making it suitable for deployment in real-world educational institutions.
